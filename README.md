## About this project

* parse log file generated by [vim-activity-log][vim-plugin-myfork] and record how long you have spent on vim per day 
* so you need to have [vim-activity-log][vim-plugin-myfork] installed
* [vim-activity-log][vim-plugin-myfork] is forked from [here][vim-plugin-origin], I did some minor modification to make the log format more consistent.
* this program could (and perhaps should) be used together with `crontab`

## installation

```bash
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install
```

## usage

you need to specify a folder to save log in `.vimrc`

```vimL
let g:activity_log_location = '~/.activity_vim/%Y/%m/%d.log'
```

then:

```bash
$ record-vim-time ~/.activity_vim
```

this should be what you'll see:

> Time you spent on VIM today: 03:11:37
